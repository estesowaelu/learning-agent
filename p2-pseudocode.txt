Given a corpus of desirable states (corpD.txt) and a corpus of undesirable states (corpU.txt), the ActionLearner.java program builds a hash of the effects various actions have, ranking them according to how beneficial (or detrimental) they are. This hash is stored in the aMem.txt file.

The Agent.java program runs on the environment laid out in env.txt, using the data in aMem.txt as a basis for its actions. Env.txt contains a sequence of sets of actions. For each set of actions, the Agent chooses the one that is most beneficial.
